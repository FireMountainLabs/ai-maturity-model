      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Or your desired Node.js version

        run: npm install # Or yarn install, pnpm install
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # Or yarn build, pnpm build (this should output to a 'build' or 'dist' folder)
